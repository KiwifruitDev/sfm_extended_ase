# SFM Extended Animation Set Editor Buttons
Adds direct element creation buttons to the Animation Set Editor in SFM.

This script can also remove the **+** button from the Animation Set Editor, if desired.

Requires [Autoinit Manager](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3400621327) to work.

## Usage
Perform the following steps to use this script:
- Make sure the Animation Set Editor is open (does not need to be the active tab).
- Install [Autoinit Manager](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3400621327) and this script.
- Once SFM has updated the Workshop items, restart SFM.
- You can now use the buttons in the Animation Set Editor to create new elements.
- If the Animation Set Editor closes, you will need to re-run this script through Autoinit Manager once it's open again.

## Settings

- Show + (Add) Button
- Show Camera Button
- Show Light Button
- Show Model Button
- Show Particle System Button
- Show Existing Element(s) Button
- Show Preset Button
You can toggle these settings to show or hide the corresponding buttons.

Also, a version number for **Extended ASE** is displayed at the bottom of the settings menu.

The following buttons have been added:
- Create Animation Set for New Camera
- Create Animation Set for Light
